To upgrade evennia core:

pip install --upgrade -e evennia

* On Windows, use "evennia.bat" instead in below commands, if running from git bash

To get into pyenv:

source ./pyenv/Scripts/activate

To init evennia:

evennia --init <gamename>

To start evennia:

* I found this doesn't work in git bash, so I run in Windows CMD:
evennia start
evennia stop
etc
