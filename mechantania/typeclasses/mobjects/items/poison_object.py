A simple poison object.

This will be [drink]able by the player.  If it is [drinked], then
the player's health will diminish by -20 HP every 10 seconds.  A message
will be sent to the player that his health is being depleted, and a message
will be sent to the room that the player looks ill.

After the player's health has reached 0 HP, the Player's HP will reset
and a message will be emitted stating the player has fake died.
